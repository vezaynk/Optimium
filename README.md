##PREVIEW
This theme is not ready yet. I just prepared the repository for when it is. Only fully functional commits will be made so you can use this to play 
around with the theme. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION! I can't garantee anything before release. Please wait before using.

#Optimium
This is the (upcoming) version 5.0 of the Optimium theme.
Based on Optimium 3.4 and Willsong 1.1's initial code-base (which is being more and more replaced with Optimium's own).

#Objectives
The theme strives to be

- Modern
- Optimized for speed
- Optimized for all screen sizes (Willsong's "Ghostship" for the grid system)
- Focus on a simple UX/UI while being visually appealing
- Staying up-to-date with the latest Ghost Releases
