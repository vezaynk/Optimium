##PREVIEW
This theme is not ready yet. I just prepared the repository for when it is. Only fully functional commits will be made so you can use this to play 
around with the theme. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION! I can't garantee anything before release. Please wait before using.

#Optimium
This is the (upcoming) version 5.0 of the Optimium theme.
Based on Optimium 3.4 and Willsong 1.1's initial code-base (which is being more and more replaced with Optimium's own).

#Objectives
The theme strives to be

- Modern
- Optimized for speed
- Optimized for all screen sizes (Willsong's "Ghostship" for the grid system)
- Focus on a simple UX/UI while being visually appealing
- Staying up-to-date with the latest Ghost Releases

##[Demo](http://knyz.org)

#How to install

1. Navigate to `/path/to/ghost/content/themes/`
2. Run the following command:
```
wget -q -O - http://bit.ly/1NRLR2X | bash
```
3. Restart Ghost
4. Select "Optimium" theme in the admin panel
5. Done!

#How to update
This is extra important right now in order to get the 5.0.0 build once 
it's released.
Just repeat the steps in the install section.
Note: Updates will overwrite any manual changes to the theme.
